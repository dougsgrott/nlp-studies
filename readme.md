# ðŸ§  NLP Studies

A structured, topic-based repository for learning and experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python.

This project is designed as a hands-on, modular guide through fundamental and advanced NLP techniquesâ€”ranging from preprocessing to semantic analysis using modern language models.

## ðŸ“š Topics Overview

Each numbered folder contains notebooks and scripts related to a specific NLP topic, following a recommended learning path:

| Folder | Topic                         | Description                                              |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `01`   | Text Preprocessing            | Clean and tokenize raw text data                         |
| `02`   | Linguistic Processing         | Analyze syntax and morphology (stemming, POS, parsing)   |
| `03`   | Vectorization                 | Convert text to numerical vectors (BoW, TF-IDF, embeddings) |
| `04`   | Language Models               | Understand and fine-tune language models like BERT       |
| `05`   | Text Classification           | Classify text into categories (e.g., topics, spam)       |
| `06`   | Question Answering            | Extract answers from context using pretrained models     |
| `07`   | Semantic Analysis             | Extract meaning: NER, sentiment, entity linking, relations |
